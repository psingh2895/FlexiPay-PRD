# üí∏ FlexiPay - Multi-Currency Wallet & Transfer Feature ‚Äì Fintech Product 

## üìå Overview
This case study outlines a proposed feature for a cross-border fintech product offering multi-currency wallets and real-time exchange rate integration. The goal was to simulate product ideation, documentation, and feature planning as a Product Analyst.

## üîç Problem Statement
Users making frequent cross-border payments face delays, manual conversion steps, and lack of real-time exchange transparency, especially in mobile-first markets.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Design a product feature enabling seamless multi-currency transfers with live exchange updates.
- Create a PRD aligned with user flows, tech feasibility, and stakeholder needs.
- Simulate MVP planning with real-world constraints and product thinking.

## üß™ Research Highlights
- Studied 4 global fintech products (Wise, Revolut, Jupiter, Niyo).
- Identified key user expectations: conversion transparency, minimal clicks, real-time rates, and budget alerts.
- Mapped pain points like re-authentication during transfers and inconsistent fee display.

## üìê Proposed Feature
- Multi-currency wallet with in-app real-time FX rate comparison.
- Transfer calculator integrated with budget alerting.
- Conversion logic automation to reduce manual steps by ~40%.

## üìà Impact (Simulated)
- The automation logic and UI redesign were benchmarked with mock users and validated for feasibility by product mentors.
- Created a PRD used as a reference in peer discussions for MVP planning and feature prioritization.
- Helped improve my own understanding of stakeholder mapping, tech dependencies, and cost estimation for cross-border features.
